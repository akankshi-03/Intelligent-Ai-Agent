An LLM-Powered Career Assistant with Tool Integration & Vector Memory
🚀 Overview

This project implements an Intelligent AI Agent that combines:

🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs)

🗂️ Vector-based Memory System

🛠️ External Tool Integration

🔎 Context-Aware Reasoning

The agent is designed to function as a career-focused AI assistant, particularly for AIML aspirants, providing structured guidance, step-by-step reasoning, and intelligent responses enhanced with memory retrieval.

This project demonstrates practical understanding of:

LLM architecture

Retrieval-Augmented reasoning

Tool-augmented AI systems

Context management using vector databases

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional chatbots:

Do not remember past interactions

Cannot use tools dynamically

Lack structured reasoning

This project solves those limitations by building a:

Stateful AI Agent capable of reasoning, remembering, and acting.
